# Airtable Timeline Component

## What I Like About My Implementation
- The overall UI and user experience
- The clean, interactive look

## What I Would Change If I Did It Again
- Use a UI with a broader color palette and a more professional, polished structure and design
- Focus even more on excellent user experience and professional UI design

## Design Decisions & Inspiration
- Inspired by Airtable's timeline view for layout and interactions
- Focused on compact, readable code and a professional UI

## How I Would Test With More Time
- Use React Testing Library for unit and integration tests
- Add automated UI tests for accessibility and responsiveness
- Test with larger datasets and edge cases

## How to Build and Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open in your browser (usually http://localhost:1234)
