# Airtable Timeline Component

### 🔄 What I Would Change If I Did It Again

- Use a broader color palette and a more polished, professional structure.
- Focus even more on excellent user experience and refined UI design.
- Consider using other helpful libraries (within the scope of the instructions) to further improve functionality and development efficiency.

### 🛠️ Design Decisions & Inspiration

- Inspired by Airtable's timeline view for layout and interactions.
- Prioritized compact, readable code and a professional UI.

### 🧪 How I Would Test With More Time

- Use React Testing Library for unit and integration tests.
- Add automated UI tests for accessibility and responsiveness.
- Test with larger datasets and edge cases.
